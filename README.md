# Dotfiles 💠

 
**Namaste!** I have been using Linux from like almost 2 years now and have been loving it ever since, It made me love using my Laptop again which used to run like a toaster back then with windows, Another thing which happened for better is that I have been a lot into ricing my Dekstop the way I want so I get comfortable with it and be more intentional and productive

I have been loving different color schemes and people who put so much effor into this.
